## What is the Skool Marketplace?
The Skool Marketplace is a place where you can find tools called plugins that make your Skool community even better. These plugins help you do all sorts of things, like planning events, making quizzes, or writing blog posts.

## Why Did I Create This?
I created the Skool Marketplace because I wanted to give you more ways to make your community exciting and useful. With these plugins, you can customize communities to match exactly what you need, whether it's for teaching, sharing hobbies, or anything else.

## What Can You Find Here?
Here are some examples of what you can add to your community from the marketplace:

- **Event Planner**: This tool helps you schedule and organize your events easily.
- **Quiz Master**: With this, you can create fun quizzes for everyone to enjoy and learn from.
- **Blog Builder**: This lets you write and share your own blog posts with others in your community.

## How to Use the Marketplace
1. **Visit the Marketplace**: Just go to the Skool Marketplace on your community page.
2. **Pick a Plugin**: Look through the plugins and find one that fits what you need.
3. **Install It**: Click on the plugin and follow the instructions to add it to your community.
4. **Payment**: Automatically adds to the monthly billing under Skool.
