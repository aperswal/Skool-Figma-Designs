# Welcome to the Skool Marketplace!

## What is the Skool Marketplace?
The Skool Marketplace is a place where you can find tools called plugins that make your Skool community even better. These plugins help you do all sorts of things, like planning events, making quizzes, or writing blog posts.

## Why Did I Create This?

- **Event Planner**: This tool helps you schedule and organize your events easily.
- **Quiz Master**: With this, you can create fun quizzes for everyone to enjoy and learn from.
- **Blog Builder**: This lets you write and share your own blog posts with others in your community.
